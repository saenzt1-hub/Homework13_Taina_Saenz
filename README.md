This is the same memory game, but now with a new feature, a Progress Bar!
With this new progress bar, you'll see your progress in the game as you find the matching flowers.
Once you find a match, the blue line in the progress bar will start to go more and more towards the right direction. 
And once you've found all the matches in the game, the line will fill the entire bar, and then reset once you start a new game!
It's a fun, interactive game with a new way to see it! (I just used to logic from Lab 2, as this was made before Lab 3!)
